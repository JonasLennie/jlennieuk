My personal portfolio website, which you can have a look at [here.](https://jlennie.uk/)
This project involved working with React and Gatsby, as well as deploying the site, originally on a Linux server, and then migrating to Firebase. I've also registered a custom domain, which, of course, I can also receive emails to.

This is a fairly simple, if quite quickly thrown together site, but I've tried to keep things as readable as possible in the code. React is still fairly new to me at time of working on this project, and I'm enjoying it much more than messing about with PHP and HTML, which I spent too many years doing.
